    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy homemade biscuit recipe with baking powder used as the leavening. The biscuits turn out perfectly soft and flaky on the inside every time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cold milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in shortening with fork or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into flour mixture while stirring with a fork. Mix in milk until dough is soft, moist and pulls away from the side of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead dough briefly, 5 to 7 times. Roll dough out into a 1/2 inch thick sheet and cut out biscuits with a floured cookie cutter. Press together unused dough and repeat rolling and cutting procedure.</li>
        <li>Place biscuits on ungreased baking sheets and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
